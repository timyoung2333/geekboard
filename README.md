## Why GeekBoard?

Most project management tools are bloated, slow, and store your data on remote servers.
**GeekBoard** is different. It is designed to be:

-   **Fast**: No loading spinners, no complex frameworks.
-   **Private**: 100% Local Storage. Your data never leaves your browser.
-   **Minimalist**: Focus on your tasks, not the tool.

## Features

-   ✅ **Kanban Board**: Organize tasks by status (Todo, In Progress, Done).
-   ✅ **Multiple Projects**: Manage different contexts in one place.
-   ✅ **Dark Mode**: A neon-inspired dark theme for late-night coding sessions.
-   ✅ **Zero Setup**: No login, no database, no installation required.
